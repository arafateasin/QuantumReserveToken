Contract Address (Sepolia): 0xafB025Bf2c44E26Ce20132304948430d7978ebb7

🔹 1. Executive Summary
QuantumReserveToken (QRT) is a next-generation, Ethereum-based ERC-20 token designed for scalable, secure, and upgradeable DeFi, Web3, and institutional asset infrastructure. Engineered with compliance, automation, and developer flexibility in mind, QRT is fully compatible with existing DeFi protocols and supports advanced features like meta-transactions, token capping, minting control, and blacklist management.

🔹 2. Vision & Mission
Vision:
To become the backbone utility token powering decentralized economies where security, governance, and innovation coexist.

Mission:
To deliver a robust and adaptable token standard that meets enterprise needs, complies with global standards, and facilitates safe community growth.

🔹 3. Key Features
Feature	Description
🛡️ Pausable	Allows pausing token transfers in emergencies or compliance scenarios.
🔥 Burnable	Holders can burn tokens to reduce supply, introducing deflationary pressure.
🎯 Capped Supply	Maximum supply enforced by smart contract logic (1,000,000 QRT).
✅ Mintable	Controlled minting through role-based access (MINTER_ROLE).
🧾 ERC-2612 Permit	Enables meta-transactions — gasless approvals for DeFi users.
🚫 Blacklisting	Owner can blacklist suspicious or sanctioned addresses.
🔐 Access Control	Role-based permissioning for secure governance and automation.
🧱 Upgrade-Ready	Can evolve into a proxy upgradeable contract architecture in V2.
🔍 Etherscan Verified	Verified on-chain to promote transparency.
